# my_note

##### This repository is where I upload my book notes and created for personal interests. Though it might be weird that notes appear on GitHub, I consider them as code for living a fruitful life. Any comments or opinions toward either the book or my notes are welcomed!

##### My preference for books: Classics, Sci-Fi, Biography, Essay, Poetry, Humanities, TBA.

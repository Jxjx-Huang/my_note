# my_note

This repository is where I upload my book notes and created simply for personal interests. 

Though it might be weird that notes appear on GitHub, I consider them as code for living a fruitful life. 

My preference for books: Classics, Sci-Fi, Biography, Essay, Poetry, Humanities, TBA.

Any comments or opinions toward either the books or my notes are welcomed!
